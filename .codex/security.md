# Security Standards

This document defines security policies and controls.

## Security Controls

<!-- BEGIN_CONTROLS -->
| Control | Enforcement | Notes |
|---------|-------------|-------|
| No arbitrary code execution | Strict | Banned: pickle, eval, exec |
| Safe YAML parsing | Strict | Use safe_load() only |
| Dependency scanning | Required | Run on every PR |

<!-- END_CONTROLS -->

## Cryptography Policy

<!-- BEGIN_CRYPTO_POLICY -->
- Use cryptographically secure random number generation
- Never implement custom cryptography
- Use approved libraries for cryptographic operations
- Keys must be managed through secure key management
<!-- END_CRYPTO_POLICY -->

## Banned Patterns

The following patterns are explicitly forbidden:

- `eval()` – Arbitrary code execution
- `exec()` – Arbitrary code execution
- `pickle` – Deserialization attacks
- `os.system()` – Shell injection
- `yaml.load()` – Unsafe YAML parsing

## Dependency Policy

- All dependencies must be in the approved list
- Security vulnerabilities must be addressed within 48 hours
- Regular dependency audits are required
